        <h2 class="title" id="par_1">Before Corona.</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Before Corona existed, people used to meet up to do all different
          types of tasks, whether to work or study. Programs and other helping
          tools for digital communication existed, yet they were not used a lot
          because there was less need for them back then.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title" id="par_2">During Corona.</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Overall lockdown, caused by the Corona crisis, made people stay
          unconnected physically. Though there were other options that were
          accessible for the individuals and the companies. Online meetings
          became an option for those who needed it, for example, Apps like Zoom,
          Skype, Microsoft Teams, … became very popular to finish the job.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title" id="par_3">After Corona (Present and future).</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Physical meetings became possible again in 2021; however, there was
          still a need for a digital way of contact. We can consider this type
          of meeting as a very huge innovation and even a revolution. It was
          something new, useful, and implemented and helped the world not to
          stop completely because of the crisis. It also didn’t thoroughly
          replace the typical way of meeting, but instead, it became an
          alternative.

          Universal Design from our perspective
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Mainly, the first and foremost goal in developing products is to solve
          a problem, whether it was general, or it is specified for one
          customer. When a programmer is asked to solve a certain problem, not
          only a solution will be found necessarily, but the programmer is also
          required to meet all types of needs that a customer would have.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Example on that is the design. In the video, a design of a photo
          writer was changed from red to yellow, because the red color reminded
          the farmers, whom are the actual users, with mouses, which we can
          consider as an enemy to them farmers. From that, can we deduce that
          not only the essence of the solution matters, but even also how the
          solution looks like.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          It matters that when you see a color, a logo, or anything that is
          designed, you feel comfortable, and the key of knowing the right
          result you will provide, so you should have your customer's
          interaction, and without it, you are risking failing. We cannot assume
          that design and data are separate. Data deals with codes that are
          hidden behind what is visual. Design is what is visible that everyone
          can see. For programming or something else that is made to be done, it
          must be completely clear with both coding that is not visible how it
          is coded and with the design that you can see when the product is
          absolutely finished.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          If the design is not well made, then the product will not be
          attractive or if there is an error in the code then the program will
          not be stainable. This means that design and our study, which is
          computer engineering, are completely adjacent to each other. A small
          illustration can summarize everything:
